Title: A Whisper in the Rain

Setting:
A quiet, rainy evening in a small coastal town, under flickering streetlights by an old bookstore.

Characters:

Aarav: A shy writer struggling with his first novel.

Meera: A free-spirited artist who sketches strangers from the bookstore window.

Plot:

Aarav ducks into the bookstore to escape the rain. Dripping wet, he wanders through the aisles until he notices Meera by the window, lost in her sketchbook. She notices him too — the dripping boy who looks like a lost poem.

They talk about books, art, and forgotten dreams as the rain falls harder outside. Meera shows him a sketch: it’s him, standing by the window, looking for something more than shelter.

A sudden power cut plunges the store into darkness. By the faint glow of streetlights, their whispers grow more honest — fears, regrets, what-ifs.

When the lights return, they stand closer than they should. Aarav finally finds the courage to speak the words he’s been writing in his mind:

"Would you meet me here tomorrow? The rain might come again."

Meera smiles, slips her sketch of him into his pocket, and whispers back:
"Only if you promise to write our story."

End.
